# Autofill Search Bar for Fruits

Hello there! üëã I'm excited to share with you the Autofill Search Bar project that I've just completed. In this project, I've designed and built a user-friendly autofill search bar that suggests various types of fruits based on user input. It's like the autofill feature you find in search engines, making it easy for users to find their favorite fruits quickly.

## Project Overview

This project centered around the creation of an Autofill Search Bar, emulating the widely used feature found in search engines like Google. The key objectives were to provide real-time suggestions of fruits as users type, dynamically update the dropdown with relevant options, and ensure a seamless interaction where clicking on a suggestion populates the search bar.

## Objectives:
1. **Autofill Suggestions:**
Generated real-time suggestions using JavaScript based on user input.
2. **Dynamic Dropdowns:**
Dynamically updated the dropdown to reflect evolving user input.
3. **User-Friendly Interaction:**
Implemented a responsive design with effortless population of the search bar on suggestion click.
## Significance:
* **Front-End Development:**
Explored and applied front-end development skills to create a polished user interface.
* **Real-world Application:**
Simulated a condensed version of a widely used feature, providing practical experience.
* **Responsive Design:**
Ensured a consistent user experience across various screen sizes and devices.
